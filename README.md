This repository contains Python implementations of common data structures.

### What is a data structure?

A data structure is a way of organizing data so that it can be efficiently accessed and manipulated.

### What are the benefits of using data structures?

Data structures can help to improve the performance of your code by making it more efficient to access and manipulate data. They can also make your code more readable and maintainable.

### What are the different types of data structures?

There are many different types of data structures, each with its own strengths and weaknesses. Some common data structures include:

* Lists
* Stacks
* Queues
* Trees
* Graphs

### How do I use the data structures in this repository?

The data structures in this repository are implemented as Python classes. To use them, you will need to import the corresponding module into your code.

For example, to use the `List` class, you would import the `datastructures` module and then create a new list object:


import datastructures

my_list = datastructures.List()


You can then add, remove, and access elements in the list as needed.

### How can I contribute to this repository?
